Investigation of Multivariate Datasets



This is based of a coursework i completed during my MSc Data Science degree at LJMU.
The aim was to investigate several multivariate datasets through generating plots of my own choice.
From there i demonstrated relevant trends in the data and discussed what implications that could mean.
The code demonstrates how the data was read, cleaned and manipulated to present the relevant trends.


All datasets used were from the UC Irvine (UCI) Machine Learning Repository Database at : http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php
